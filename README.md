# gloveTrack Database

This repository is a submodule of https://github.com/shasheene/gloveTrack, organising the images and video files used to train and evalulate the performance of gloveTrack.

These files are used during development, and for demonstrating gloveTrack.  In a real-world environment, a unique set of training and search data will need to be generated (currently manually using Gimp).
